# Seam-Carving-Functional-Algorithm
Description: A seam carving algorithm that calculates the "importance" of pixels and removes the least important pixels from an image to crop it in the cleanest way possible. The algorithm is written twice, once with dynamic programming, and once with memoization. A Big-O analysis of both versions of the algorithms are included.
